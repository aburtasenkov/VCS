# VCS - Lightweight Version Control System

VCS is a simple, lightweight version control system written in C++. It mimics basic features of Git, allowing you to create and manage commits, track document changes, and handle repositories in a modular way. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how a version control system can be built from the ground up.

## 🚀 Features

- Basic commit and repository management
- Document state tracking
- Exception handling for robust operations
- Helper utilities for streamlined I/O
- Lightweight and modular C++ design

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

Ensure you have a C++17-compatible compiler installed (e.g., g++).

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o vcs main.cpp Commit.cpp Document.cpp iostream_helper_functions.cpp
./vcs
```

## 🧪 Running Tests
